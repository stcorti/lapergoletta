The apartment is placed inside an historical stone farmhouse that has been recently renewed. In the farmhouse is hosting multiple apartments with similar dimentions. The apartment has the typical architecture from Tuscany (e.g. artistic roof with wooden rafters, etc.).

Outside the apartment you can find a garden with a private pergola with a seating area. We really recommend to enjoy some food outside and enjoy the beautiful panorama. 

The apartment La PERGOLETTA can host up to 5 guests (3+2) and is divided in two floors.

From the garden you can access directly the living room. In the living room you can find a small kitchen (hob, fridge and microwave oven), a table, a convertible couch (twin beds) and a TV. The small kitchen is equipped with all the necessary kitchenware to enjoy your stay.

At the upper floor you can find a bathroom with a shower box and a bedroom. The bedroom has a double bed and a single bed. From the window in the bedroom you can enjoy the panorama just after you woke up.

Optionally, you're free to use the private private pergola. There you can enjoy a BBQ (shared with other apartments) in a relaxing environment thanks to multiple deck chairs.
